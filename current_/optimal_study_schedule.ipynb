    "# Optimizing My Study Schedule with PuLP\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization of learning schedules is pivotal in educational efficiency. This study explores the use of linear programming to construct a study timetable anchored in the principles of spaced repetition. This cognitive strategy, which staggers information review, aims to fortify long-term material retention. The challenge addressed herein is the strategic allocation of study and review sessions within a limited weekly timeframe, ensuring adherence to reinforcement learning principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a committed learner with aspirations toward research, I recognize the power of spaced repetition—a technique drawn from cognitive science that enhances memory retention by employing systematically increasing review intervals. This methodology is not academic; it's a practical solution to a challenge I face: organizing my study schedule for an upcoming semester packed with diverse subjects. My goal is to not just learn, but to learn effectively, using the tools of research to craft a timetable that reflects both my academic obligations and my curiosity about how we learn best.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "With several subjects to study in the coming semester, including Fundamentals of Logistics, Technical Fundamentals, Fundamentals of Computer Science, and more, I am tasked with a complex scheduling endeavor. Each subject requires dedicated study and review sessions—components critical to the spaced repetition method that I am eager to apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of subjects I wish to cover this this period:\n",
    "- Fundamentals of Logistics (FoL) \n",
    "- Technical fundamentals (TeFun) \n",
    "- Fundamentals of Computer Science (FoCSN) \n",
    "- Introduction to Scientific Working (SW) \n",
    "- Technical Logistic System (TLS) \n",
    "- Planning Logistic System & Processes (PLS&P) \n",
    "- Traffic Planning & Engineering (TrE) \n",
    "- Data Management (DM) \n",
    "- Linear Programming (LP) \n",
    "- Legal requirements and international regulations (LRIR) \n",
    "\n",
    "The question arises: How can I fit multiple sessions for 11 subjects into a week's structure, which offers only 42 slots when 44 are needed? To address this, I must prioritize and strategize, perhaps allowing for some subjects, such as Scientific Writing and Legal Requirements and International Regulations, to have fewer sessions. Data Management might also see a reduced schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal is clear: create a timetable for a 6-row, 7-column table that embodies the essence of reinforcement learning, allowing no more than three days between studies for optimal recall ability. This is more than an exercise in time management—it's an application of spaced repetition, a testament to my journey as a learner and an example of research in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us denote a set of subjects by $S = \\{s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n\\}$ where each subject  $s_i$ requires a sequence of study sessions $S1, S2$ and review sessions $R1, R2$. Each session is designated as a 1 to 2-hour time slot. The goal is to schedule these sessions over a week, defined by $D = \\{d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_7\\}$, with a fixed number of time slots per day denoted as $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each subject $s_i$, we define the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_{s_i, t, d} = 1$ if subject $s_i$ has a session at time slot $t$ on day $d$, $0$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints of the problem are formulated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each subject must have a predetermined number of study and review sessions.\n",
    "2. Sessions for different subjects cannot overlap.\n",
    "3. Review sessions must be scheduled within a certain number of days after the study session to ensure effective spaced repetition.\n"
