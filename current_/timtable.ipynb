    "# Study Timetable thoughts:\n",
    "\n",
    "I have to study the following subjects the upcoming semester:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fundamentals of Logistics (FoL) with S1, S2 , R1, R2\n",
    "- Technical fundamentals (TeFun) with S1, S2 , R1, R2\n",
    "- Fundamentals of Computer Science (FoCSN) with S1, S2 , R1, R2\n",
    "- Introduction to Scientific Working (SW) with S1, R1\n",
    "- Technical Logistic System (TLS) with S1, S2 , R1, R2\n",
    "- Planning Logistic System & Processes (PLS&P) with S1, S2 , R1, R2\n",
    "- Traffic Planning & Engineering (TrE) with S1, S2 , R1, R2\n",
    "- Data Management (DM) with S1, S2 , R1\n",
    "- Linear Programming (LP) with S1, S2 , R1, R2\n",
    "- Legal requirements and international regulations (LRIR) with S1, S2 , R1, R2\n",
    "\n",
    "Where S1,S2 are Study sessions 1 and 2 respectively. R1 and R1 are the respective review sessions. Each session would be a 2hr slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal is to create a timetable, keeping in mind each 11 subjects consist of S1, S2, R1 and R2. So how do i know is it possible to create a combination? because 6x7 is 42 and 11x4 is 44, that means two subjects needs only S1 and R1, it can be Scientific Writing (SW) and Legal requirements and international regulations(LRIR). Also Data Management (DM) needs only S1, S2, R1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now I can find a solution and program it. for a 6rows and 7 column table with proper reinforcement learning or recall ability (not more than 3 days from previous study) included for each subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The reinforcement learning ability in a timetable context means ensuring that study sessions and their respective review sessions are spaced in a way that is conducive to memory retention. This is commonly known as spaced repetition, which is a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent reviews of previously learned material."
